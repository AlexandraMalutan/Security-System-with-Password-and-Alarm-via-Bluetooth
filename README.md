I used the Arduino board because it is user-friendly and compatible with a wide range of sensors, modules, and electronic components. I connected all the components and wrote the code so that the program indefinitely waits for a password to be entered. If the correct password is entered, the servo motor opens the door. However, if an incorrect password is entered, a message appears, requiring the user to wait 10 seconds before attempting to enter the password again.

Additionally, the Bluetooth module adds a modern and smart element to the system, making it appealing to those who seek technological solutions for protecting their personal belongings. First, the phone must be connected to the HC-05 Bluetooth module. In the Arduino BlueControl app interface, there is a "Buttons and slider" option. If button 1 is pressed, the buzzer starts sounding like an alarm, and if button 2 is pressed, the buzzer stops.
